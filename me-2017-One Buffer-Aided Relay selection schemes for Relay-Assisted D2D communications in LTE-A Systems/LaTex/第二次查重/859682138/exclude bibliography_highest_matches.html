However, owing to the <a href="javascript:openDSC(255910441, 2909, '16998');" onmouseover="doRollover(2);" onmouseout="undoRollover(2);" id="16998" name="2" style="color:green" class="green"><span class="b-ref">2</span>long separation<span> distances </span>or poor link quality between the source and destination user</a> devices (UDs), the advantages of D2D communications is limited by only using direct D2D com- munication. For improving the system performance of cellular network, relay-aided D2D communications was put forward as a complement for direct D2D communications. The purpose of this article is to devise a relay selection method that improve the D2D communication performance. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Aware and Buffer-Assisted (EABA) relay selection method that take account of certain conditions jointly, including transmission rate, relay-available UD (RUD) residual energy, and RUD buffer state. At each time slot, according to the channel state, energy, and buffer size, a scheduling rule is calculated dynamically by the EABA relay selection method. And then, which of the links is activated to transmit packet is specified by the scheduling rule. Numerical examples are presented to show the performance of the EABA method.

INTRODUCTION To satisfy the increasing demand<span> of mobile communication, </span>device-to-device (D2D)</a> communications is proposed as a effective technique for cellular network [1–3]. D2D commu- nication includes licensed-frequency and unlicensed-frequency D2D [4]. Unlicensed-frequency D2D communication is usu- ally exposed to the unknown dangers. Therefore, a lot of projects in this field study in licensed-frequency D2D, in <a href="javascript:openDSC(59954356, 37, '4169');" onmouseover="doRollover(21);" onmouseout="undoRollover(21);" id="4169" name="21" style="color:#336699" class="#336699"><span class="b-ref">21</span>order to enhance the<span> overall cellular </span>network performance,</a> such as spectrum and energy efficiency, by using mode selection and frequency reuse [5–7]. However, a majority of recent works have only studied in <a href="javascript:openDSC(555347073, 37, '14');" onmouseover="doRollover(17);" onmouseout="undoRollover(17);" id="14" name="17" style="color:#63009c" class="#63009c"><span class="b-ref">17</span>direct D2D communications. The advantages of D2D</a> com- munications is limited by only using direct D2D communi- cation, because the failure of direct D2D communications is probably caused by the <a href="javascript:openDSC(255910441, 2909, '17000');" onmouseover="doRollover(2);" onmouseout="undoRollover(2);" id="17000" name="2" style="color:green" class="green"><span class="b-ref">2</span>long separation<span> distances </span>or poor link quality between the source and destination<span> D2D-capable </span>user</a> devices (DUDs) [8]. To solve the question, relay-aided D2D communications was supposed to explore the profits of D2D communications [9, 10]. The range of D2D communications is obviously extended by using relay [11]. Compared to fixed relay [12], the relay-capable UD (RUD) aided D2D communication is more helpful owing to the explosive growth of UE. Thus, a lot of the works use RUD instead of fixed relay in relay-aided D2D Communications. With the help of a RUD, two DUDs be able to communicate with each other even if they are separated by great distance or the link between them is poor[9, 10]. To apply relay-aided D2D communications in cellular net- work, the most important work is selecting optimal RUD under BS’s control. The issues of relay selection have been widely discussed in cellular network cooperative communications. Most relay selection methods are executed on two successive time slots, which at the previous slot, the packet are sent from source to RUD and at the next slot, the destination receive the packet transmitted by the relay. This relaying method is known as conventional relaying [13]. Moreover, most of the existing relay selection methods focused on physical layer (PHY), the residual energy and buffer state of candidate relay node was basically ignored. What’s more, the channel reuse is not included in most of these methods. <a href="javascript:openDSC(53079529, 37, '3045');" onmouseover="doRollover(3);" onmouseout="undoRollover(3);" id="3045" name="3" style="color:blue" class="blue"><span class="b-ref">3</span>In this<span> paper, </span>we<span> focused </span>on relay-aided D2D</a> communica- tion.

All of these UDs are controlled by A. Link Transmission Rate Estimation BS. We assume that there is only one source and destination As shown in Fig. 1, the link transmission rate is derived in DUD in the cellular. We also assume that there are M CUDs this subsection.

Moreover, presume that M CUDs use M separated cell ySi,Rj = hS,Rj · xS + hCi,Rj · xCi + n0 (3) uplink channels which have same bandwidth and can be reused by D2D communication.

RUD Residual Energy And Buffer State Estimation Owing to the finite energy of the relay, the relay only forward a finite amount of data before the energy is exhausted. Thus, even though a relay has sufficient buffer size, it’s no use sending more data to the relay than it can forward later. To take this into account, we should know the data size can be transmitted by RUD Ri under the residual energy. Let E1, E2, . . . , Ej, . . . , EN denote the total energy of N RUDs, respectively. To describe the influence of the discharge current and transmission power of each RUD on RUD remain- ing work time, Peukert’s Law [16] is expressed as τj = Ej /Ijα (8) where τj is the remaining work time of Rj , Ij is discharge current, and α is the Peukert constant and its usually equal to 1.3 [16]. Using PRj denotes the transmission power of Rj , the discharge current can be expressed as Ij = PRj /V0 (9) where V0 denote the discharge voltage of each UD and predefine the same V0 for each UD. Therefore, we can establish the remaining work time of each RUD which we know residual energy, transmission power, and discharge voltage. In this paper, the transmission power of all UDs are predefined as a fixed value, so we can use the remaining operation time τj denotes the residual energy of RUD Rj . Then the minimum data size transmitted by RUD Rj can be expressed as θj = Rmin · τj (10) where Rmin is the minimum transmission speed of RUD Rj Moreover, the energy of the selected relay is decreased, i.e., τj(t + 1) = τj(t) − tranj(t), where tranj(t) denotes the transmission time of RUD Rj to the destination. Qj(t) is the amount of data stored in RUD Rj, so ej(t) = Lj − Qj(t), where Lj denotes the total buffer size of RUD Rj, so ej(t) is the buffer size of RUD Rj can be used <a href="javascript:openDSC(503827825, 37, '14492');" onmouseover="doRollover(22);" onmouseout="undoRollover(22);" id="14492" name="22" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">22</span>at the<span> starting </span>of time slot t.</a> And then, the tranj <a href="javascript:openDSC(1782240399, 2474, '18972');" onmouseover="doRollover(14);" onmouseout="undoRollover(14);" id="18972" name="14" style="color:#9c6331" class="#9c6331"><span class="b-ref">14</span>(t) can be expressed as<span> tranj </span>(t) = T<span> {Qj </span>(t)/</a> RRj <a href="javascript:openDSC(7351276, 37, '10736');" onmouseover="doRollover(10);" onmouseout="undoRollover(10);" id="10736" name="10" style="color:#00cc99" class="#00cc99"><span class="b-ref">10</span>,D(t)<span> RRj </span>,D(t)·T<span>&gt;</span><span>Qj </span>(t)<span> RRj,D </span>(t)·<span> T </span>≤Qj(t)<span> (11) where </span>T is</a> duration of a time slot, and RRj,D <a href="javascript:openDSC(519371383, 37, '11955');" onmouseover="doRollover(19);" onmouseout="undoRollover(19);" id="11955" name="19" style="color:#cc0066" class="#cc0066"><span class="b-ref">19</span>(t) is the data rate of link</a> Rj → D at time slot t. 500 400 300 Evolved Node B (eNB) 200 Cell coverage 100 Distance between DUDs 0 Source DUD Destination DUD -100 Cellular UE (CUD) -200 Relay capable UE (RUD) -300 -400 -500 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 Fig. 2. The simulation of the scenario. The distance between the S and D is 220m. C. EABA Strategy For the purpose of transmitting the file as quickly as possibly, Energy-Aware and Buffer-Assisted (EABA) executes depending on the following theory: the relay which has a lot of residual energy and buffer space should have a higher priority to recept data. On the other hand, if the relay has a large number of data in its buffer, it should get a higher priority to transmit data to the destination. What’s more, a link with a high SINR, which means that more data will be transmitted at a time slot, should have a higher chance to transmit data. In the EABA method, the BS calculates the weight of every link S → Rj as WS→Rj =min(θj−Qj,ej)·RS→Rj·K[γS→Rj ≥γd)] (12) while K[x] is zero when x is false and one when x is true. Hence, a link S → Rj get a valid weight only when RUD Rj has enough buffer space and residual energy, and the link SINR must no less than the predefined SINR requirement for D2D link. Similarly, for link Rj → D, the BS calculates the weight as WRj→D = Qj · RRj→D · K[γRj→D ≥ γd)] (13) According to (13), a link Rj → D get a valid weight only when relay Rj has data stored in its buffer. After adopting EABA method calculating the weight, the link lmax which has the highest weight is selected, where lmax = arg l∈{S→Rj }∪{Rj →D} max {Wl} (14) Algorithm 1 shows the execution process of the EABA method. The EABA method considers transmission rate of each link, residual energy and buffer state of each relay, so the BS needs to know all of there information. When the link with the highest weight is activated by BS, the BS will notify the whole D2D network either the S should transmit to the selected relay or the selected relay transmit to the D. Algorithm 1 EABA Relay Selection Method 1: Each RUD calculates the minimum data size that can be transmitted by itself using (10) and sends residual energy and buffer state to the BS. 2: The BS computes the weight for link S → Rj using (12). 3: The BS computes the weight for link S → Rj using (13). 4: Under BS controls, the best link is selected based on (14). As long as the network is available, the procedure of EABA continues. Depending on the above discussion of the EABA method, if relay Rj has data stored in its buffer, Rj will have enough energy to transmit that data. Note that there will be a time slot in which that link Rj → D will have a good channel condition, Rj will transmit the data which has been stored in Rj to the D successfully. Hence, if the network becomes unavailable, there will be no data stored in relay Rj . <a href="javascript:openDSC(40090049, 37, '8961');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="8961" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS In this section, we<span> provide </span>simulations<span> in MATLAB </span>to evaluate the</a> proposed relay selection method. Simulation is performed in a single cellular, and we assume that the cellular radius is 500 meters. We also assume that all CUDs are random distributed in the cellular. Besides, there are only two DUDs (the S and the D), and all RUDs are random distributed in a circular area with the distance between the S and the D as its radius and the S as its center. The simulation of the scenario is shown in Fig. 2, and Table I lists main parameters used in this paper. Since all UDs are re-deployed random in different test, we did 100,000 times experiments at the same scenario for getting an average result. The EABA relay selection method is validated by the simulations as shown in Fig. 3, 4, 5. To evaluate the necessity of it, we make a comparison of ”EABA relay selection” with ”random <a href="javascript:openDSC(54510177, 37, '8242');" onmouseover="doRollover(16);" onmouseout="undoRollover(16);" id="8242" name="16" style="color:#cc9900" class="#cc9900"><span class="b-ref">16</span>relay selection” and<span> ”rate based </span>relay selection”.<span> All </span>the<span> three </span>relay selection</a> methods assume that direct D2D mode is unavailable, that is to say, the three methods are only working in relay-aided D2D mode. Moreover, we also ignore the time and energy consumption caused by calculation. The ”random relay selection” selects a link randomly; The ”rate based relay selection” selects a link with maximum SINR, i.e., the maximum transmission rate; while the ”EABA relay selection” selects the link which is calculated by the formula proposed in Section III. Fig. 3 demonstrates the probability of successful communi- cations using the three relay selection methods. As the distance between DUDs S and D decreases, the chances of successful communication are greatly improved. The result is very plausi- ble, as the average distance between random distributed RUDs and DUDs will decrease with the decreasing distance between the S and D. So the channel gain of link between DUDs and RUDs will increase with an decreasing distance, which will improve the chance of successful communication. Specifically, the EABA method presents the best performance. The reason is that random relay selection method randomly selects a link, SINR of which may not meet the requirements and TABLE I SIMULATION PARAMETERS Parameters Value Cellular radius 500 m Noise density -174 dBm/Hz The number of CUD UE transmit power 20 24 dBm The number of DUD 10 Path-loss constant (K0) Path-loss exponent (α) 0.01 4 SINR requirements (γc, γd) 20 dB Slow fading (βs,d) Log-normal distribution with mean value of zero and stan- dard deviation of 10 Fast fading (ζs,d) Exponential distribution with mean value of one Packet number 50 Packet size A unit time slot (△T ) RUD total energy (Ei) 1024 bits 1µs Randomly distributed in [0,1440] mAh 1 0.9 Success probability of communications 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 Random relay selection(SINR requirements is 70dB) 0.4 Rate based relay selection(SINR requirements is 70dB) EABA relay selection(SINR requirements is 70dB) 0.3 Random relay selection(SINR requirements is 20dB) Rate based relay selection(SINR requirements is 20dB) 0.2 EABA relay selection(SINR requirements is 20dB) 0.1 020 60 100 140 180 220 Distance between the S and D (m) Fig. 3.

Rate based relay selection method selects a link has maximum link transmission rate, but the RUDs buffer states and residual energies are not considered. Even though the method selects a link from S to RUD with maximum link transmission rate, but the RUD does not have enough buffer space or residual energy which may lead to communication failure. Furthermore, no matter which method is applied, D2D communication achieves higher success probability under a lower link SINR requirement. Fig. 4 shows that the total data transmission time decreas- es when the distance between S and D is expanded. The transmission rate of both S-to-RUD and RUD-to-D links will be reduced by expanding separation distance, directly resulting in a decreased amount of transmission data in all of links. Thus, the total transmission time will go up. In the three methods, the EABA method has the minimum total transmission time, because it has a higher data rate and communications success probability. The random relay selection method shows the worst performance, due to its lowest link data rate and communications success probability. 7 #10 11 Total transfer time of Random relay selection Total transfer time of Rate based relay selection Total transfer time of EABA relay selection 6 Total tranfer data of Random relay selection Total tranfer data of Rate based relay selection Total tranfer data of EABA relay selection Total data that can be transmitted within RUD residual energy (bits) 5 4 3 2 1 0 20 60 100 140 180 Distance between the S and D (m) #104 5 4 3 2 Total data transfer time (us) 1 220 0 Fig. 4.

The total transmission time with varying buffer size, and channel bandwidths. The distance between the S and D is 180m. Although rate based relay selection method select the fastest link, but the lower communication success probability leading to a lower transmission time than EABA method . Fig. 4 shows that the influences of the distances between the S and D on the total amount of data transmitted by the three relay selection methods. As the distances increasing, the path loss will significantly enhance, leading to a decreasing link transmission rate. Moreover, under the same cellular param- eters, the random method affords a much worse performance than the other two selection methods, because both the selected link data rate and residual energy of RUD are neglected. Despite rate based method chooses the link which has highest transmission rate to transmit data, it will consume all of the energy of the system quickly, because it is not consider the residual energy of RUD. The EABA method provides the best performance, because it not only ensure the system work more time, but also ensure the link data rate. Fig. 5 illustrates the effects of the size of RUD’s buffer on the total transmission time with various bandwidths. With the same bandwidth, if buffer size is less than 5, increasing the buffer size of RUDs leads to a decrease in the total data trans- mission time. As the buffer size increases, the probability of successful communications increases, and this leads to lower total data transmission time. Otherwise, the total time isn’t influenced by buffer size when it is greater than 5. The reason is that the communication failure caused by lacking of buffer size does not happen when RUDs has enough buffer size. No matter which method is used, enhancing channel bandwidth will significantly decrease the total data transmission time, causing a bigger bandwidth leads to a higher transmission rata for each link. What’s more, the total data transmission time of EABA method is shorter than that of other methods with same buffer size and bandwidth, and the strength of EABA method is more dramatically at lower bandwidth. V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we designed an Energy-Aware and Buffer- Assisted (EABA) relay selection method that jointly con- sidered transmission rate, RUD residual energy, and RUD buffer state. We also described the compute processes of the transmission rate, RUD residual energy, and RUD buffer state. Specially, we established a relay selection method which select the best link instead of selecting best relay. <a href="javascript:openDSC(52986901, 37, '18246');" onmouseover="doRollover(18);" onmouseout="undoRollover(18);" id="18246" name="18" style="color:#cc6600" class="#cc6600"><span class="b-ref">18</span>Simulation results<span> showed </span>that the proposed method<span> provides the </span>better</a> overall transmission performance compared with other relay selection methods. <a href="javascript:openDSC(59025512, 37, '10977');" onmouseover="doRollover(5);" onmouseout="undoRollover(5);" id="10977" name="5" style="color:#ff6600" class="#ff6600"><span class="b-ref">5</span>ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the National Key Technolo- gy R&amp;D Program</a> (No.2015BAI01B14) <a href="javascript:openDSC(2038898078, 2909, '24832');" onmouseover="doRollover(13);" onmouseout="undoRollover(13);" id="24832" name="13" style="color:#9966ff" class="#9966ff"><span class="b-ref">13</span>and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.</a> REFERENCES [1] K.
